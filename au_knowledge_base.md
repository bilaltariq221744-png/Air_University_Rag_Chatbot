Social scientists and investigators can distinguish the most up-to-date academic developments as a vital academic exchange platform and pursue indispensable crucial foundations for reference.

**Phonetics, Phonology, Morphology, Semantics, Pragmatics, Syntax, Genre Studies, Corpus Linguistics, Sociolinguistics, Applied Linguistics, English Language Teaching, Discourse Analysis, Language Documentation, Trauma Studies, Perpetrators Studies, Feminism, Postcolonial Studies, Eco- Criticism, and Memory Studies.**
Our mission is to showcase quality research being carried out in literature and linguistics in Pakistan and around the world. This is hoped to be done by the contributions of researchers from a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives.

The campus is located near the Margalla foothills in the south east corner of sector E-9 (PAF Complex) of Islamabad. The main entrance is adjacent to the intersection of Agha Shahi Avenue (9th Avenue) and Khayaban-e-Iqbal (Margalla Road).

The University promotes research in all disciplines. Faculty members are encouraged to help develop the education system and curricula of the university using their experience and research. Faculty development and updating of courses are given high priority and are undertaken as a regular academic requirement. 
####  About Air University Multan Campus 
As a federally chartered, public sector university, AIR University can operate all over Pakistan. Southern Punjab consists of four divisions, Multan, Sahiwal, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan. Large numbers of students from this region desiring higher education in Management Sciences and Computer Engineering move to educational institutions in Lahore, Islamabad or Karachi. 
The city of Multan is well placed to serve not only these four divisions, but also adjoining areas in Sind, Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. In view of the heavy pressure of students seeking admission to courses of the kind offered by AIR University, the Prime Minister directed for the establishment of the Multan Campus of the University. The management conducted a feasibility study and decided to set up two faculties, Applied and Basic Sciences and Administrative Sciences in Phase I, to be followed by Engineering in Phase II. The University started the Multan Campus in the heart of the city in a rented building named Khan Centre at Abdali Road, Multan Cantt. In the fullness of time the campus will be constructed over an area of 200 acres in the suburbs of Multan. 
The University announced admission for two programs, BSCS and BBA (Honors) in the month of January 2011 and classes for these programs started on April 19, 2011. From Fall 2011 semester a third degree program, MBA (3 ½ years), is also being offered. 
The campus is closely linked with the parent departments of the main campus and have worked a regular mechanism of knowledge sharing with them. The Multan campus is linked through PERN with the main campus. The facility of teleconferencing is provided. Therefore the class lectures of Islamabad campus and scholars of international repute are supplemented. 
The efforts are underway to hire highly qualified and professionally experienced teachers in the fields of finance, marketing, management and computer science. A computer lab has been established at the campus with internet facility. This computer lab is connected with HEC digital library. The students of these programs have almost unlimited access to the computer and professional software tools and other facilities of the main campus. The library of the campus is going to be established with the latest books in all areas of management sciences and computer science.

Dean's Message 
The Air University School of Management (AUSOM), as an academic unit of Air University, has carved a distinct place for itself amongst the top national business schools. Built purposefully for imparting learning through new and innovative methods of teaching, the environment of the department has been further galvanized through the case-based method of teaching. This provides an excellent and enabling environment for the students to hone in their management skills.
It is this unique combination of technology integration, a customized learning structure, and a faculty par excellence that makes AUSOM an exceptionally unparalleled learning Institution. Strong industry-academia linkage established by the School through a continuous process of interaction with corporate industry leaders in workshops, seminars, lectures and other extracurricular events has placed AUSOM at a uniquely advantageous position. With a distinctive competitive advantage and an enthusiastic and inspired student body produced by the School, a large number of leading firms and corporate entities take part in Air University campus recruitments. 
AUSOM alumni is serving at different leadership positions in various private, public, multinational, government, profit and nonprofit organizations. This distinctive position attained by AUSOM would not have been possible without the dedication and untiring efforts of a professional team. The students, faculty members, administrative staff, and the University management cohesively form the closely aligned core of this team. Together we ensure a culture of continuous learning, flexibility, friendliness, and discipline.

About Us 
#### CPEC Center of Excellence at Air University School of Management, Islamabad was established in Feb 2018.
Establishment Ceremony of “CPEC Center of Excellence at Air University School of Management” was held in Islamabad (main) campus of Air University.
**Minister of State and Chair Board of Investment Mr. Naeem Y. Zamindar inaugurated the center.**
Prof. Dr. Idrees Khawaja (Dean Air University School of Management), Mr. Muhammad Saleem Ranjha (Additional Secretary/ Executive Director General BOI), AVM (R) Tariq Matin (Director Academics), Air Cdre (R) Muhammad Saleem (Registrar AU), Air Cdre (R) Afzaal Ahmad (Director ORIC), Air Cdre (R) Abdul Wahab Motla (Director QEC), Dr. S. K. Shahzad (Head CPEC Center AU) were present at the occasion.
On behalf of Air University Prof. Dr. Idrees Khawaja delivered the welcome speech. He suggested that establishment of CPEC Center of Excellence at AU was an important step and would have significant and positive impact on CPEC related research. Other senior officials representing AU had also ensured that center shall play its role in promoting research relating international business especially Export Processing Zones.
Mr. Naeem Y. Zamindar, said that he assigned high value to CPEC Centers of Excellence in Pakistan, especially the ones that operate at the universities’ level. He hoped that scholarly community of China and Pakistan, through these Centers shall increase the overall cooperation to give boost to the science and technology.
#### Projects at CPEC Center of Excellence AUSOM
✓ For Pakistan, China-Pak Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a fate changer. Technically this south Asian developing country will act as an Entrepot to China. In this newly developing contextual setting, Export Processing Zones (EPZs) will have significant implications not only for the economy of Pakistan but also for the economy of whole globe. Apart from economic contributions, EPZs—as an important tool to promote international trade—are expected to contribute towards human welfare in Pakistan. 
Therefore, CPEC Center of Excellence at AU, aims to understand how the contribution of EPZs towards human welfare, in post-CPEC scenario can be maximized in Pakistan. Towards this end, a project tilted “Positioning for Maximal Gain: How the Human Welfare Output of Export Processing Zones in a Developing Country’s context can be maximized?” was proposed to Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan. HEC has approved Rs. 1.76 Million for completion of this project in 30 months.
Successful completion of this project shall help Ministry of Industries, Planning Commission of Pakistan, Ministry of Climate Change, Export Processing Zones Authority etc. Moreover, export related industries—textile steel, hi-tech industry, gem & jewelry, software houses, information technology based industries, precession engineering, blister, copper, gold, lead and zinc, steel billets, direct reduced Iron (DRI) and many other industries listed on official website of Export Processing Zones Authority (EPZA) will indirectly benefit from this study Please See: <http://www.epza.gov.pk>
✓ In another project, CPEC Center of Excellence at AUSOM is also helping Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis (Overseas Pakistani Foundation) in establishing the state of the art university in Islamabad Pakistan.

Dean Message 
  

FCAI is one of the leading and fastest-growing computing Faculties in Pakistan due to its quality academic, research and enterprise activities. In 2016, FCAI was a computer science department with two-degree programmes, 500 students, and 2 research groups. In 2019, the department progressed to Faculty of Computing & Artificial Intelligence with three different Departments. These are Department of Computer Science, Creative Technologies and Cyber Security which conduct 15-degree programmes, and have 10 research groups, 3 technical student societies, and 1500 students. All new academic programmes have been started with an aim to produce a skilful workforce which can contribute to international computing markets. It is very encouraging to highlight that FCAI students’ job placements and success in winning International scholarships have increased substantially in recent years. 
FCAI faculty members are rated among world’s top 2% researchers and are actively engaged in bringing external research grants. Our highest priority is to prepare the next generation of scientists through our MS and PhD programmes to solve computing domain challenges, while providing the training our students need to compete and excel in the field. In future, we plan to establish leading national research labs.

**Dean, FCAI**
After successfully establishing an academic and research base, FCAI now is seriously geared up for enterprise activities to generate revenue and provide economic benefits in Pakistan. FCAI has established a local Research & Enterprise office to actively support research & enterprise activities. As part of the plan, FCAI has established a Air University Computing Academy to run world’s leading technologies’ certification programmes of Huawei, Oracle, Microsoft, and CISCO to create more job opportunities for students. Furthermore, we have started active work to encourage and prepare our students and faculty members to establish new start-ups. We envision to become the centre for establishing successful and world-leading companies in the emerging fields of computing. 
FCAI faculty members, students and staff have successfully established an active team which works as a family in a very congenial environment. Accordingly, FCAI successes and indicator are on the rise. 
I invite you to come and visit our Faculty, its departments and research labs, and to explore our website to discover more about FCAI. 
We look forward to welcoming you.

Faculty of Aerospace and Strategic Studies (FASS) - Introduction 
Faculty of Aerospace and Strategic Studies (FASS) was established in 2018 with the main objective of raising awareness about space related issues and its strategic relevance for Pakistan’s national security. Within FASS, Department of Strategic Studies (DSS) offers several academic programs, including BS International Relations (IR), MS International Relations & Security Studies (IR&SS), and PhD Strategic Studies (SS) programs.
Bachelor of Science in International Relations (BS-IR) is a four-year degree program comprising of eight semesters. During the course of study students get an opportunity to understand how states structures function and interact with the rest of the world. After graduating the students have the opportunity to explore career options in government, non-government organizations, and various international institutions and organizations. 
Masters of Science in International Relations and Security Studies (IR&SS) is a relatively new program and has replaced MS Strategic Studies (SS) that was being offered earlier at the department. Besides theoretical understanding of international relations the students of MS IR&SS get an opportunity to familiarize themselves with the existing and emerging security challenges. This combination has the potential to open more job opportuntities for the graduates of MS IR&SS program.
Doctor of Philosophy in Strategic Studies (PhD SS) program is designed for those who aspire to contribute original research in the field of strategic studies with a main focus on space, emerging technologies and nuclear deterrence.

Transfer Students 
The Vice Chancellor after consultation with relevant faculty may allow transfer of students from recognized institutions and reputed universities under specific conditions. A student expelled from another institution on disciplinary grounds cannot transfer to AU. 
Applications for transfer are submitted to the Director of Academics using a form available on the website. 
The transfer student must complete at least 50 percent of the required credit hours at AU to earn the degree. Courses with grade less than "B minus" cannot be transferred and will need to be retaken at AU. If admitted, the student will be informed clearly what courses may be transferred and what additional courses may be needed. The student must have at least CGPA of 2.5 to be considered for transfer. The final decision is taken by the Vice Chancellor. 
#### Transfer of Program within AU
Transfer to another program is generally discouraged but under special circumstances an enrolled student may apply for transfer from one program to another, in the first two semesters of the program. The application is to be submitted to the respective Chair Department at least two weeks before the start of the semester in which the student is seeking a program transfer. Only students with CGPA of at least 3.0 may apply.

Introduction 
Air University was established as a federally chartered public sector university in October 2002 with a focus to develop human resource mainly in the area of engineering and applied sciences. With more than twenty batches, graduated in three different program of Electrical Engineering, along with Mechatronics Engineering, these 'products' of the Faculty have found their place in society either as professionals serving industry or as the budding academics of tomorrow being trained in institutions at home and abroad. Yet, the Faculty of Engineering is in its infancy undergoing the usual problems, crises and challenges that have shaped educational institutions in this stage. Faculty development and academic enrichment is an ongoing activity.
At Faculty of Engineering, our main focus is on five areas of specialization including electronics, telecommunications, power, mechatronics and computer engineering, while an undergraduate program in mechanical engineering also exists in the same premises under the Institute of Avionics and Aeronautics.
Our faculty is qualified, experienced and fully in tune with the vision and mission of the university. Lab infrastructure plays a vital role in any of the engineering program. Our engineering labs are well equipped with all necessary state of the art learning tools and advance hardware infrastructure, to support and enhance student’s skill level in affective and psychomotor domain to complement cognitive domain knowledge from the classroom lectures. We thus have a fully operational engineering programs at undergraduate and graduate levels including MS and PhD. These all programs are OBE accredited at level II by the Pakistan Engineering Council since 2018, showing our continuous commitment toward quality education in engineering program.
Air University is very much committed toward bridging the industry-academia gap. We have established industrial advisory boards at university as well as department level. Members for these boards are very carefully chosen so that they can guide us to develop our curriculum to inculcate industry driven gradating attributes in our graduates to make them market and industry ready. Air University has established strong linkages with many well reputed universities and institute nationally and internationally to strengthen the research projects undertaken by faculty and students. 
Due to our long term commitment towards quality education, many of our graduates have proceeded for higher education not only in Pakistan but also abroad in world leading universities. Their performance while pursing higher education in engineering, is extraordinary as our trained and devoted faculty has done its best to provide a solid foundation in their engineering education. At Faculty of Engineering, we assure our students, a quality education and full experimental support for their studies as per market needs and requirements. We guarantee a conducive environment at Air University for the students to prepare themselves properly for their promising future as a successful engineering professional. With a focused and dedicated approach, and consistent hard-work, a student is bound to find time spent here well rewarded.

Faculty of Social Sciences 
Social Sciences are an incumbent part of any university’s basic curriculum. Social Sciences help explain the world in which we live. They help students define their role in the society and develop their ability to think critically.
The Faculty of Social Sciences is one of the vibrant Faculties at Air University. It is hosting three Departments and a number of programs that are leading the field in the areas of knowledge, research and community building.
The Department of English houses one UG and 08 Graduate Programs, including two new programs of MPhil Litertaure and MS TESOL to fulfill the needs of its graduates. Its BS, MPhil and PhD Programs are one of the most sought after programs in the country. English language courses are also taught to the undergraduate students of Engineering, Basic, and Administrative Sciences by our well-trained faculty. The Department of Psychology has become a highly successful program at the BS and MPhil level for its cutting edge research and faculty expertise. The Department of Education and Humanities not only offers MPhil Education degree, but also offers Humanities courses taught to undergraduate students of Engineering, Basic and Management Sciences. A new addition to the faculty is the introduction of BS in Media and Communication which promises great future fue to the emerging potential in the field. 
The Faculty of Social Sciences also aims to extend its programs and courses in various fields for graduate and postgraduate students to combine academic rigor and research design with a strong focus on real-world experience, involving their engagement in the field of social sciences. The faculty is committed to put a strong focus on practical skills along with moral ethical code – to prepare students for an in-depth exploration of contemporary social issues with an intellectual and practical engagement in their chosen field. The faculty also desires to draw on its unique strengths in collaboration with other organizations to establish Social Sciences Research Centre, (SSRC) with the purpose to respond to the contemporary challenges of the society. The Faculty of Social Sciences encourages students to combine their theoretical knowledge of the contemporary world with an understanding of the cultural and political processes to participate more effectively in the formal and informal events.

Dean's Message 
  

Welcome to the National Cyber Security Academy (NCSA) at Air University, the first-of-its-kind initiative in Pakistan dedicated to advancing education, training, and research in Cyber Security.
Our journey began in 2018 with the launch of Pakistan’s pioneering undergraduate program in Cyber Security. Today, NCSA has evolved into a comprehensive Academy with four schools offering BS, MS, and PhD programs, a specialized training center, and a state-of-the-art cyber range. We are also proud to host the National Center for Cyber Security (NCCS) along with specialized cyber security laboratories.
Our vision is to position Pakistan as a global leader in Cyber Security education, research, and industry collaboration. Guided by this vision, our mission is to nurture skilled talent, foster innovation, and strengthen national resilience in the digital domain. We are committed to four core objectives: building a world-class workforce, advancing curriculum excellence, driving sustainable economic growth, and achieving global leadership.

With state-of-the-art facilities, globally benchmarked curricula, and a strong emphasis on experiential learning, the Academy stands as a hub for cultivating the next generation of Cyber Security professionals, researchers, and innovators.

###  Welcome to our project "ReCyP:HER"!
The goal of the project "Rethinking Cybersecurity in Pakistan – Human factors‘ Essential Role“, short RECYPHER, is to create a comprehensive capacity building in Pakistan for the area of cybersecurity and the connection with psychological know-how.
This project is funded by the European Union within the Erasmus+ program. The applicant, the Chair of Industrial and Organizational Psychology at Saarland University, is working together with the five project partners Lahore University of Management Sciences, National University for Sciences and Technology in Islamabad, Air University in Islamabad, the Institute of Business Administration in Karachi and the Cybersecurity Center at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul.
Cybercrime poses a major threat to the economic growth of developing countries. With the aim of using psychological know-how in the field of IT security, the project aims to raise awareness of cyber security issues and to promote the establishment of close networks between universities and IT security companies in Pakistan.
