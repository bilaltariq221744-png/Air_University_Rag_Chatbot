## About the Journal
**Erevna: Journal of Linguistics and Literature is a blind peer-reviewed** journal that publishes original and high-quality research papers in various areas of linguistics and literature. Social scientists and investigators can distinguish the most up-to-date academic developments as a vital academic exchange platform and pursue indispensable crucial foundations for reference.
The paper should deal with the latest developments in linguistics and literature. As the journal has a uniquely broad coverage aiming to publish quality research in the relevant areas with an emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches in the analyses, we accept original papers addressing any aspect of linguistics and literature in the following areas:
**Phonetics, Phonology, Morphology, Semantics, Pragmatics, Syntax, Genre Studies, Corpus Linguistics, Sociolinguistics, Applied Linguistics, English Language Teaching, Discourse Analysis, Language Documentation, Trauma Studies, Perpetrators Studies, Feminism, Postcolonial Studies, Eco- Criticism, and Memory Studies.**
Our mission is to showcase quality research being carried out in literature and linguistics in Pakistan and around the world. This is hoped to be done by the contributions of researchers from a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives.

####  About Air University Multan Campus 
As a federally chartered, public sector university, AIR University can operate all over Pakistan. Southern Punjab consists of four divisions, Multan, Sahiwal, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan. Large numbers of students from this region desiring higher education in Management Sciences and Computer Engineering move to educational institutions in Lahore, Islamabad or Karachi. 
The city of Multan is well placed to serve not only these four divisions, but also adjoining areas in Sind, Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. In view of the heavy pressure of students seeking admission to courses of the kind offered by AIR University, the Prime Minister directed for the establishment of the Multan Campus of the University. The management conducted a feasibility study and decided to set up two faculties, Applied and Basic Sciences and Administrative Sciences in Phase I, to be followed by Engineering in Phase II. The University started the Multan Campus in the heart of the city in a rented building named Khan Centre at Abdali Road, Multan Cantt. In the fullness of time the campus will be constructed over an area of 200 acres in the suburbs of Multan. 
The University announced admission for two programs, BSCS and BBA (Honors) in the month of January 2011 and classes for these programs started on April 19, 2011. From Fall 2011 semester a third degree program, MBA (3 ½ years), is also being offered. 
The campus is closely linked with the parent departments of the main campus and have worked a regular mechanism of knowledge sharing with them. The Multan campus is linked through PERN with the main campus. The facility of teleconferencing is provided. Therefore the class lectures of Islamabad campus and scholars of international repute are supplemented. 
The efforts are underway to hire highly qualified and professionally experienced teachers in the fields of finance, marketing, management and computer science. A computer lab has been established at the campus with internet facility. This computer lab is connected with HEC digital library. The students of these programs have almost unlimited access to the computer and professional software tools and other facilities of the main campus. The library of the campus is going to be established with the latest books in all areas of management sciences and computer science.

#### CPEC Center of Excellence at Air University School of Management, Islamabad was established in Feb 2018.
Establishment Ceremony of “CPEC Center of Excellence at Air University School of Management” was held in Islamabad (main) campus of Air University.
**Minister of State and Chair Board of Investment Mr. Naeem Y. Zamindar inaugurated the center.**
Prof. Dr. Idrees Khawaja (Dean Air University School of Management), Mr. Muhammad Saleem Ranjha (Additional Secretary/ Executive Director General BOI), AVM (R) Tariq Matin (Director Academics), Air Cdre (R) Muhammad Saleem (Registrar AU), Air Cdre (R) Afzaal Ahmad (Director ORIC), Air Cdre (R) Abdul Wahab Motla (Director QEC), Dr. S. K. Shahzad (Head CPEC Center AU) were present at the occasion.
On behalf of Air University Prof. Dr. Idrees Khawaja delivered the welcome speech. He suggested that establishment of CPEC Center of Excellence at AU was an important step and would have significant and positive impact on CPEC related research. Other senior officials representing AU had also ensured that center shall play its role in promoting research relating international business especially Export Processing Zones.
Mr. Naeem Y. Zamindar, said that he assigned high value to CPEC Centers of Excellence in Pakistan, especially the ones that operate at the universities’ level. He hoped that scholarly community of China and Pakistan, through these Centers shall increase the overall cooperation to give boost to the science and technology.
#### Projects at CPEC Center of Excellence AUSOM
✓ For Pakistan, China-Pak Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a fate changer. Technically this south Asian developing country will act as an Entrepot to China. In this newly developing contextual setting, Export Processing Zones (EPZs) will have significant implications not only for the economy of Pakistan but also for the economy of whole globe. Apart from economic contributions, EPZs—as an important tool to promote international trade—are expected to contribute towards human welfare in Pakistan. 
Therefore, CPEC Center of Excellence at AU, aims to understand how the contribution of EPZs towards human welfare, in post-CPEC scenario can be maximized in Pakistan. Towards this end, a project tilted “Positioning for Maximal Gain: How the Human Welfare Output of Export Processing Zones in a Developing Country’s context can be maximized?” was proposed to Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan. HEC has approved Rs. 1.76 Million for completion of this project in 30 months.
Successful completion of this project shall help Ministry of Industries, Planning Commission of Pakistan, Ministry of Climate Change, Export Processing Zones Authority etc. Moreover, export related industries—textile steel, hi-tech industry, gem & jewelry, software houses, information technology based industries, precession engineering, blister, copper, gold, lead and zinc, steel billets, direct reduced Iron (DRI) and many other industries listed on official website of Export Processing Zones Authority (EPZA) will indirectly benefit from this study Please See: <http://www.epza.gov.pk>
✓ In another project, CPEC Center of Excellence at AUSOM is also helping Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis (Overseas Pakistani Foundation) in establishing the state of the art university in Islamabad Pakistan.

###  Welcome to our project "ReCyP:HER"!
The goal of the project "Rethinking Cybersecurity in Pakistan – Human factors‘ Essential Role“, short RECYPHER, is to create a comprehensive capacity building in Pakistan for the area of cybersecurity and the connection with psychological know-how.
This project is funded by the European Union within the Erasmus+ program. The applicant, the Chair of Industrial and Organizational Psychology at Saarland University, is working together with the five project partners Lahore University of Management Sciences, National University for Sciences and Technology in Islamabad, Air University in Islamabad, the Institute of Business Administration in Karachi and the Cybersecurity Center at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul.
Cybercrime poses a major threat to the economic growth of developing countries. With the aim of using psychological know-how in the field of IT security, the project aims to raise awareness of cyber security issues and to promote the establishment of close networks between universities and IT security companies in Pakistan.
