## About the Journal
**Erevna: Journal of Linguistics and Literature is a blind peer-reviewed** journal that publishes original and high-quality research papers in various areas of linguistics and literature. Social scientists and investigators can distinguish the most up-to-date academic developments as a vital academic exchange platform and pursue indispensable crucial foundations for reference.
The paper should deal with the latest developments in linguistics and literature. As the journal has a uniquely broad coverage aiming to publish quality research in the relevant areas with an emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches in the analyses, we accept original papers addressing any aspect of linguistics and literature in the following areas:
**Phonetics, Phonology, Morphology, Semantics, Pragmatics, Syntax, Genre Studies, Corpus Linguistics, Sociolinguistics, Applied Linguistics, English Language Teaching, Discourse Analysis, Language Documentation, Trauma Studies, Perpetrators Studies, Feminism, Postcolonial Studies, Eco- Criticism, and Memory Studies.**
Our mission is to showcase quality research being carried out in literature and linguistics in Pakistan and around the world. This is hoped to be done by the contributions of researchers from a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives.
